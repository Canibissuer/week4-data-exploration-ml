# week4-data-exploration-ml
## Assignment Overview
This assignment practices data exploration (EDA), feature engineering, and basic modeling using Python and scikit-learn. Work is completed in a Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab) and submitted through GitHub.

## What I Did
- Loaded a dataset and reviewed rows, summary statistics, and missing values
- Identified feature types and created visualizations (histogram + scatter plot)
- Performed feature engineering:
  - Created a binned categorical feature and applied one-hot encoding
  - Created a new engineered numeric feature
- Trained and evaluated a simple model (Logistic Regression; optionally Random Forest)
- Reflected on what was challenging and how choices affected performance

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook:
   - `week4_data_exploration_ml.ipynb`
2. Run the cells top to bottom.

## Requirements
This notebook uses:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
